# Script for "Temporal variation in markers of immune signaling and wound repair in primary human airway epithelial cells following acute vs. repeated woodsmoke condensate exposure"

Script authors: Elise Hickman (ehickman@email.unc.edu), Jessie Chappel (jrchapp3@unc.edu)

The goal of this study was to understand the effects of acute and repeated exposure to woodsmoke condensate on primary human bronchial airway epithelial cells (manuscript in submission). 

**1_TEERandLDH:** Analysis of trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) data and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity assay data.

**2_RNAsew:** Analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data. 

**3_SecretedProteins:** Secreted protein data preprocessing/filtering, imputation, and statistical analysis.
